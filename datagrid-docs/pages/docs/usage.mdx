  <title>Material React Table - Usage</title>

## Usage

In order to start using DataGrid, you need to first [install](/docs/install) `datagrid` and it's peer dependencies.

There are additional steps and customizations you can do for material-ui, if you have not set it up in your application already. Check out the [material-ui docs](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) for more information.

Once you have everything installed, you can import `datagrid` like this:

```jsx
import DataGrid from '@ialopezg/datagrid';
```

To get started creating a basic table, all you need to do is to provide the **columns** definitions and the table **data**.

```jsx
<DataGrid
  columns={columns} //must be memoized
  data={data} //must be memoized
/>;
```

> **Note:** It is very important to *memoize* the columns and data that you pass to DataGrid. Otherwise, the entire table will be re-rendered during every react render in your application, and can lead to performance issues. To learn more, checkout the [react-table docs](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/quick-start#getting-your-data).



Each column definition must have at the very least, an `accessor` propery. This is the key that will be used to join the data from the `data` values. A Header string can also be provided to display the column header.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(() => [
  { Header: 'Name', accessor: 'name' },
  { Header: 'Age', accessor: 'age' },
], []);
```

Your data is an array of objects that have properties matching the accessors in your column definitions.

```jsx
const data = useMemo(() => [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Sara', age: 25 },
], []);
```

Throw it all together and you have a basic table!

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import DataGrid from '@ialopezg/datagrid';

export default function App() {
  const columns = useMemo(() => [
    { Header: 'Name', accessor: 'name' },
    { Header: 'Age', accessor: 'age' },
  ], []);

  const data = useMemo(() => [
    { name: 'John', age: 30 },
    { name: 'Sara', age: 25 },
  ], []);

  return <DataGrid columns={columns} data={data} />;
}

```

Now this is just the default table that you get. You may want to disable some features that you don't need, or enable
and customize other features that you may want. See the [minimal example](/docs/examples/minimal) and [advanced example](/docs/examples/advanced) to get a
better idea for how you may want to customize your table, and visit the [all props page](/docs/props) to see all the
props that you can use to turn features on and off, and customize the look and feel of your table.
