## About DataGrid

<Summary />

### Motivation

[`@ialopezg/datagrid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ialopezg/datagrid) started out as an attempt to upgrade the popular
[material-table](https://material-table.com/) library to Material-UI V5 and TypeScript, since that project seems to have
become abandoned. However, after a few frustrating weeks, it was discovered that it would be easier and more fun to write
a new advanced Material UI table library from scratch. [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) naturally seemed
like a great basis for the underlying API, and so it was chosen as the foundation for the project.

### Project Goals

- Stick to material design principles
- Fully enable all features of the [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) API (as much as reasonably possible)
- Prefer performance and bundle size over over-the-top built-in features
- Enable full customization easily (CSS, layout, icons, localization, etc.)
- Be unit test friendly
